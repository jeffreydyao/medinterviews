The medicine admissions process revolves around two domains of evaluation: academic performance (*UCAT, HSC, GPA*) and personal characteristics/aptitudes (*MMI, SSI*). 

Receiving an interview means you've cleared the academic hurdle. As such, the focus here is on getting to know **you**, so the medical school knows you're the right fit for their program. 

Medical schools look for these general qualities. 
- Problem-solving ability
- Self-appraisal ability
- Ability to relate to others
- Motivation to study medicine
- Your learning style
- Maturity and responsibility
- A range of interests

They meet the profile of a physician[^1], who: 
- recognises personal assets and limitations
- evaluates emotional reactions, and is sensitive to the needs and contributions of colleagues and patients
- is a life long learner
- capable and flexible of selecting any specialty in the broad field of medicine
- effective member of groups engaged in various educational, research and clinical activites
- has the ability to apply general knowledge to issues relevant to the culture and society in which they practice medicine. 

So, in the interview you should be demonstrating these qualities and presenting your best self. 

The following questions focus on fleshing out who you are, in order to build a portrait of you: the candidate. There are also questions on issues relevant to culture and society, to build your general knowledge. It is up to you to paint your portrait: do so thoughtfully.
